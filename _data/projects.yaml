  description: Through a unique collaboration with an existing ULA program in the UT College of Natural Sciences, our research team developed a weekly supplemental “fellowship” for ULAs of a large, introductory Chemistry course. A key component of this training was to create a collaborative environment where ULAs had ample time to share instructional challenges and discuss inclusive practices to best support their students. Using a randomized-controlled trial design, we find that ULAs randomly assigned to this fellowship used more inclusive practices and reported higher belonging. Their students also reported more positive engagement and comfort in course discussion sections, and fewer group disparities in their experiences.
